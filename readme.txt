Hello tutors!

Just some instructions before running my code (nothing major):

- Please install all libraries mentioned in the code

- If you're trying to change the code and test it, please remeber to sort the filtered data by 'CLUE Area' and 'Year' for the 4th visualisation, else you'll get some wierd line graphs!

- Please view my DVP implementation in browser with scale of zoom set to default value of 100&. My code does use fluidRow() implementation, so there'll be no issues if you try to zoom out but the visualisations might get distorted if you zoom in.

- Once you run my code in RStudio, and open my webpage on browser, it takes about 1 to 1.5 secs for the Visualisations to load and render; please wait patiently!

- At times, after running my web app in RStudio and Closing the app, RStudio might not end the running of the app on the console and might cause RStudio to restart afresh (terminates current session and starts new one). I have not checked if this issue is only on my system or on all - please be WARNED!

Thanks for evaluating my DVP! 

And thanks for tutoring me this sem! Easily the best pair of online tutors that I had this sem!
